Location 245-246 Added on Wednesday, September 22, 2021 5:54:14 PM the essence of a good work ethic starts with meeting a challenge of self-discovery, finding something you love to do, so that work-even, or especially, when it is very difficult and arduous-becomes joyful, maybe even sacred. Location 275-276 Added on Wednesday, September 22, 2021 6:00:49 PM A sane and durable work ethic keeps the emphasis not on fickle rewards, but on the work itself-on the passion and focus and seriousness of purpose with which the work is approached.

That life might be centered around work or a particular career; but it doesn’t have to be. The bliss of it-the rightness of it-can reside in any aspect of a chosen path.

No one else can do it for us; no one has the right to tell us what it ought to be. Location 2513-2514 Added on Monday, November 29, 2021 10:49:53 PM If ever-increasing material wealth can no longer be taken for granted, doesn’t it make sense to place a greater emphasis on the sort of wealth that is measured in personal fulfillment and peace of mind?
